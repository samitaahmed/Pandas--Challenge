    "- By looking at the results of top_schools and bottom_schools in the section \"Highest-Performing Schools\" and also the results of \"scores by School Size\" shows that schools with larger number of students are not performing at its best. There passing rates are better for small and medium sized schools. All of the bottom performing schools are large schools. \n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    " - We can also see that schools with the lowest budget per student has better passing rate across all the evaluated matrices than the schools who spend more on each student. The budget that each school is spending on its students are not dependent on its size.\n",
    "\n",
    "- On the other hand, Charter Schools performed much better compared to District schools.\n",
    "\n",
    "- Overall, all the top performing schools are Charter Schools that are smaller schools and has less budget than the larger district schools. \n",
    "There can be several reasons for this to happen and one can be the ratio of students to teachers. There will be more information necessary to prove this hypothesis. However, if this is the reason then larger district schools with larger budgets should focus on realigning its resources so that there are adequate student to teacher ratio.\n",
